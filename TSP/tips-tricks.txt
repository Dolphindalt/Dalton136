1) Comment: tricky bits of code
            all methods
            all instance variables
            header with all the good stuff

2) Tour of N nodes, only "new" N Node objects.

3) Linked list must be circular because:
    assignments says so
    harder if you don't

4) Special case empty tour -> expected and necessary
   Special case anything else -> not necessary, probably wrong

5) Test with special cases: 0 node tour, 1 node tour

6) In case of tie in heuristic, first position wins

7) Heuristics should NOT recalculate whole tour
   when testing each candidate insertion position

8) Circular linked lists love do-while loops
